Every year the Oxford dictionairy chooses a word of the year. <br>
This year (2015) the word was actually an emoji. In my eyes this <br>
represents the current world we live in perfectly. In stead of <br>
using text as a medium for our information exchange we use more <br>
and more imagery. This imagery exists mostly out of symbols and <br>
icons. This language evolution is encouraged by the increased use <br>
of computers in our daily lives. We communicate more via computers <br>
and <img src="work/peopleonphone.jpg" alt="phone new" height="70" width="90"/> 
than ever before, and because of the rapid developments, <br>
and fast-paced information flow we can allmost not keep up with, <br>
the icons and symbols get a more important role in our daily lives.<br><br>

When seeing the world mostly through a screen, knowing what is reality <br>
and what is not, is a line that can get blurry. <img id="icon1" src="work/1-1.jpg" height="10%" width="10%" />
Especially when the digital<br>
tries to recreate, or mimic reality it is difficult to create the divide <br>
in our minds. (example: instagram people are not real, they take the right <br>
pictures and use the right frame) What I want to talk about and what i see <br>
happening a lot around me is that becuase of (the design of) icons and symbols <br>
used on our computers and phones, the meaning of the object or situation that<br>
symbol mimics loses it’s meaning or changes it. (example: a younger generation <br>
only sees the <img src="work/floppy.png" alt="floppy" height="20" width="20" /> 
on their screen, and thus when seeing a floppy disk <br>  
in real life they think it’s a 3d version of the icon on their screen. It is <br>
a result of fast developments in technology, which make us replace the objects <br>
we have very often. We forget to remember and history in a way is lost) It is <br>
about how language and design come together and can alter meaning. This leads <br>
me to my research question: <br><br>

In what respect does the design of (digital)<br> 
symbols and icons effect the way we see the <br>
(physical) world and do we have to re-think <br>
the design accordingly?<br>
